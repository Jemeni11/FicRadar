## Introduction

**FicRadar** is a browser extension that extracts and ranks fanfiction links from user-visible forum posts and interactions. It helps you discover stories that people (especially your favorite authors) frequently interact with‚Äîby scraping and ranking their forum activity.

This project is built with the [Plasmo](https://docs.plasmo.com/) framework.

## FAQ

**Do you store my data?**  
Yes. Only on your own device. The extension uses the browser‚Äôs local storage to transfer data between components (from the popup to the open tab). Your data isn't sent anywhere else. You can open the network tab on the new tab page to confirm. FicRadar doesn‚Äôt track, save, or upload anything.

**Why do I need to be logged in?**  
Because some platforms (like QQ on some pages and AO3) require login to access subscription data. You could try without it. It could work. This hasn't been tested.

**Isn't this shady?**  
I don't think so. All this data is already publicly available. This extension just automates a process anyone could carry out manually. If you don't want your interactions on XenForo forums to be publicly visible, you can just hide your profile. This extension can‚Äôt get around that.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Why did I build this?

I like fanfiction. And I really like knowing what my favourite authors are reading. FicRadar is a way to see what stories they keep reading, commenting or talking about.

Also, I‚Äôve built other tools in this space like [FicImage](https://github.com/Jemeni11/FicImage), [TalesTrove](https://github.com/Jemeni11/TalesTrove) and contributed to [WebToEpub](https://github.com/dteviot/WebToEpub) and [Leech.py](https://github.com/kemayo/leech).
