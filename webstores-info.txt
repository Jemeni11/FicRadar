BROSWER DESCRIPTION


FicRadar is a browser extension that scrapes fanfiction links from public forum posts on SpaceBattles, Sufficient Velocity, and Questionable Questing. It looks at what people are replying to across their post history, and ranks those links by frequency.

You can scrape a single user profile or upload a file with multiple author links. The extension supports TXT and JSON files, including those exported from TalesTrove (https://github.com/Jemeni11/TalesTrove). 

Everything happens locally. There's no tracking, no background syncing, and no data is sent to any external server.

Once the scrape is done, you can export your results in multiple formats:

- JSON
- CSV
- Plain TXT (links-only)
- HTML
- Browser-importable bookmarks

Want to download everything you find? The exported TXT format works great with tools like fichub-cli (https://github.com/FicHub/fichub-cli) and FanFicFare (https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare).
